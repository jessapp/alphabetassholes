<p class="response animate">A: Have you ever exchanged dating horror stories with your friends? Have you ever exchanged so many, that you realized you could make a whole website about it? An Alphabet of Assholes is a compliation of real-life stories from our dating lives. We've abbreviated all names down to their first letters, to avoid calling anyone out.</p>
