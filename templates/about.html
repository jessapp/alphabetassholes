<h3>Learning Our A-B-Cs</h3>
<p>Have you ever exchanged dating horror stories with your friends? Have you ever exchanged so many, that you realized you could make a whole website about it? An Alphabet of Assholes is a compliation of real-life stories from our dating lives. We've abbreviated all names down to their first letters, to avoid calling anyone out.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://www.jessicaappelbaum.com/">Jessica Appelbaum</a> and <a href="http://www.anastasianikitovic.com/">Anastasia NikitoviÄ‡</a> are a couple of millenial ladies who have dated a whole bunch of assholes. Anastasia loves to draw. Jess is learning how to code. We both like to write stuff. We decided combine our talents and share our dating horror stories with the world!</p>
<h3>Woah, that story sounds familiar. Is it about me?</h3>
<p align="justify">Have you dated one of us? If so, probably! Sorry, buddy. </p>
